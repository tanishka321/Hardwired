# Hardwired
Hardware and Machine Learning based Competition, Utilize major ML Algorithm to train the bot to cover all the Checkpoints in the arena in minimum time. ROS-integrated mobile robot and performed point-to-point autonomous navigation on it in a zoo-themed arena. We used semantic segmentation for detecting roads in the arena along with custom trained animal recognition algorithm for detecting the destination. The bot localized using wheel odometry along with feedback from pose estimation on data from an overhead camera. 

# Problem Statement

The autonomus bot has to cover all checkpoint(animals in Arena) in predefined order. The bot can analyse the Arena through overhead Aruco marker based Camera.
